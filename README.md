# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my journey as an AI Architect and Product Innovator. The site highlights my skills, selected AI/GenAI projects, consulting services, and thought leadership through blogs and insights.

It follows a clean, responsive design inspired by modern UI/UX principles, optimized for both desktop and mobile. The website also includes a dedicated section for future AI-based interactive applications.
